# RPL

This is the main source code repository of RPL (Rust Pattern Language). It contains the toolchain and documentation of RPL.

## What is RPL?

RPL is a domain-specific language for modeling Rust code patterns.

The toolchain of RPL, which is a custom configuration of Rust compiler, enables accurate identification of code instances that demonstrate semantic equivalence to existing patterns.

## Features

-   Model Rust code patterns based on MIR, just like writing real Rust code.✨
-   Enable programmatic semantic equivalence checks based on CFG and DDG with graph matching algorithms. 🔍
-   Support pattern customization to simplify modeling and predicate integration to ensure precise matching. 🛠️
-   Provide clear, user-friendly error messages and actionable suggestions. 💡

## Quick Start

-   Clone the repository and enter the directory: `git clone https://github.com/RPL-Toolchain/RPL.git && cd RPL`

-   Install RPL as a cargo subcommand: `cargo install --path .`

-   Run RPL analysis on your Rust project:
    -   `cargo +nightly-2025-02-14 rpl` (using built-in RPL pattern definitions based on inline MIR)
    -   `RUSTFLAGS="-Zinline-mir=false" cargo +nightly-2025-02-14 rpl` (using built-in RPL pattern definitions based on MIR) or `cargo +nightly-2025-02-14 rpl -- -Zinline-mir=false`

> Just like using `cargo clippy` to check your Rust code.

## RPL Language Reference
